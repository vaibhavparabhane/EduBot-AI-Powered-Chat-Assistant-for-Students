# Chatbot Implementation Using NLP

This repository contains the implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to handle user queries, classify intents, and provide relevant responses.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Preprocessing, tokenization, and intent recognition.
- **Context Management:** Tracks multi-turn conversations for meaningful interactions.
- **Modular Design:** Easy to extend and integrate with various platforms.

## System Architecture
The chatbot system consists of the following components:
1. **User Interface (UI):** Provides an interactive interface for users.
2. **NLP Preprocessing Module:** Handles text preprocessing like tokenization and stop-word removal.
3. **Intent Recognition Engine:** Classifies user intents using machine learning or neural networks.
4. **Entity Recognition Module:** Extracts relevant entities using NER (Named Entity Recognition).
5. **Dialogue Manager:** Manages conversation flow and tracks context.
6. **Response Generator:** Provides suitable responses based on user input.
7. **Backend Database:** Stores predefined responses and contextual data.

## Requirements
### Hardware Requirements
- Processor: Intel Core i5 or higher
- RAM: 8GB minimum
- Storage: 100GB free disk space
- GPU (optional): CUDA-compatible GPU for deep learning models

### Software Requirements
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8 or higher
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - `NLTK`, `spaCy`, or `TextBlob` for text preprocessing
  - `Scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow/PyTorch` for intent classification
  - `Flask` or `Django` for the user interface
- **Database:** SQLite, MySQL, or MongoDB
- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS, or Linux

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-nlp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot-nlp
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Open the application in a browser or terminal.
- Enter your queries in the provided input field.
- The chatbot will process the query and provide a response.

# 🎓 EduBot: AI-Powered Chat Assistant for Students

**EduBot** is an AI-based chatbot designed to assist students with academics, programming concepts, interview preparation, career guidance, and productivity. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand queries and respond accurately — all inside a sleek Streamlit web interface.

---

## 🌟 Features

-   **Conversational Assistant:** Tailored for students to answer academic and career-related questions.
-   **Broad Subject Coverage:** Includes topics like AI, Python, SQL, resume building, and interview tips.
-   **Intelligent Query Matching:** Uses **TF-IDF** to vectorize text and **Cosine Similarity** to find the most relevant answer from its knowledge base.
-   **Natural Interaction:** Handles greetings and provides fallback responses for unrecognized queries.
-   **Lightweight & Fast Frontend:** Built entirely with Streamlit, requiring no HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
-   **Easy to Customize:** The knowledge base (corpus) is easily editable, allowing you to add more questions and answers.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The chatbot's intelligence comes from a classic Information Retrieval technique.

1.  **Corpus:** The bot is powered by a predefined set of questions and answers.
2.  **User Input:** A student types a query into the chat interface.
3.  **Text Preprocessing:** The user's query and the corpus are cleaned and standardized using techniques like tokenization and lemmatization from the NLTK library.
4.  **TF-IDF Vectorization:** The processed text is converted into numerical vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). This helps in evaluating how important a word is to a document in the corpus.
5.  **Cosine Similarity:** The bot calculates the cosine similarity between the user's query vector and all the question vectors in the corpus. The formula for cosine similarity is:
    $$
    \text{similarity} = \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\|}
    $$
6.  **Response:** The answer corresponding to the question with the highest similarity score is returned to the user. If no question meets a certain similarity threshold, a fallback message is displayed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/EduBot.git](https://github.com/your-username/EduBot.git)
    cd EduBot
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    scikit-learn
    nltk
    ```
    Then, run the installation command:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download NLTK data:**
    You will need to download the `punkt` tokenizer and `wordnet` lemmatizer. Run this command to open the NLTK downloader and select them.
    ```sh
    python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
