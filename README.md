# Chatbot Implementation Using NLP

This repository contains the implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to handle user queries, classify intents, and provide relevant responses.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Preprocessing, tokenization, and intent recognition.
- **Context Management:** Tracks multi-turn conversations for meaningful interactions.
- **Modular Design:** Easy to extend and integrate with various platforms.

## System Architecture
The chatbot system consists of the following components:
1. **User Interface (UI):** Provides an interactive interface for users.
2. **NLP Preprocessing Module:** Handles text preprocessing like tokenization and stop-word removal.
3. **Intent Recognition Engine:** Classifies user intents using machine learning or neural networks.
4. **Entity Recognition Module:** Extracts relevant entities using NER (Named Entity Recognition).
5. **Dialogue Manager:** Manages conversation flow and tracks context.
6. **Response Generator:** Provides suitable responses based on user input.
7. **Backend Database:** Stores predefined responses and contextual data.

## Requirements
### Hardware Requirements
- Processor: Intel Core i5 or higher
- RAM: 8GB minimum
- Storage: 100GB free disk space
- GPU (optional): CUDA-compatible GPU for deep learning models

### Software Requirements
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8 or higher
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - `NLTK`, `spaCy`, or `TextBlob` for text preprocessing
  - `Scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow/PyTorch` for intent classification
  - `Flask` or `Django` for the user interface
- **Database:** SQLite, MySQL, or MongoDB
- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS, or Linux

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-nlp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot-nlp
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Open the application in a browser or terminal.
- Enter your queries in the provided input field.
- The chatbot will process the query and provide a response.
